TypographyHelper
================

This is a Ruby copy of Django's Typogrify filters:
<http://code.google.com/p/typogrify/>

Widont was coined by Shaun Inman:
<http://shauninman.com/archive/2006/08/22/widont_wordpress_plugin>

widont_single is taken from <http://mucur.name/posts/widon-t-and-smartypants-helpers-for-rails>

Also uses RubyPants Gems <http://chneukirchen.org/blog/static/projects/rubypants.html> originally SmartyPants by John Gruber <http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/>

A set of filters to provide typographical hooks to Rails views. Basically a Ruby port of the Typogrify template filters for Django.

I don't know much about Typography, but I do know that curly quotes look better than straight ones, that HTML entities look better than plain-text, and that Django users shouldn't have all the fun.

Included filters (filter name in parentheses):

* Widon't (*widont* also *widont_single* for one-line transformations)
* RubyPants (*rubypants* requires rubypants gem)
* Initial quotes wrapped in class='dquo' or class='quo' depending on if they are single or double (*initial_quotes*)
* Ampersands wrapped in class='amp' (*amp*)
* Multiple adjacent capital letters wrapped in class='caps' (*caps*)
* A do-all filter (*rubyshirt*)
* A do-all filter (*rubyoutfit* aliased as *t* to keep views clean) that runs *rubypants* and *rubyshirt* in that order
* A do-all filter that includes *rubyoutfit* and Rail's *h* function (*th*)

**To get it**, navigate to your Rails root directory

**To use it**, simply add the appropriate function name before your <%=  %> output  
(e.g. change <%= @article %> to <%= rubyshirt @article %>)
